# PCA_tSNE
I have used mnist dataset for PCA & tSNE.This technique is used for dimensionality reduction to visualize higher dimension datesets to lower datasets.
# Please Note:
tSNE data is generated on very few sample data since code takes few hours to generate. Please try to run
the report on full data. Code might take > 12 hours to generate. or you need powerful machine.
Comment lines below in source code to see better tSNE graphs. Also try to increase perplexity, learning_rate and n_iter.
Keep tryig changing the data until you see stable tSNE plots.
